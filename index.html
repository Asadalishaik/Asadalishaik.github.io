            <h2>What is AI?</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction.</p>

        <section id="history-of-ai">
            <h2>History of AI</h2>
            <p>The history of AI began in antiquity, with myths, stories, and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956, where the term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined.</p>
            <p>AI has since evolved through different stages, from rule-based systems to machine learning and deep learning.</p>
