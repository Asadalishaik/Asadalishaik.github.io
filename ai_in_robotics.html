            <h2>AI in Robotics</h2>
            <p>AI plays a crucial role in robotics by enabling robots to perceive their environment, make decisions, and perform tasks autonomously. Machine learning algorithms allow robots to learn from experience and improve their performance over time.</p>

        <section id="applications">
            <h2>Applications of AI in Robotics</h2>
            <p>AI-powered robots are used in various applications such as manufacturing (assembly line robots), healthcare (surgical robots), agriculture (autonomous tractors), space exploration (rover robots), and more.</p>
